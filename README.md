# Localization

These are the current languages we support:
- Latin
- Vietnamese

By default, Poppins (Latin) will be loaded. We use the [`unicode-range` CSS descriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) to load SVN Poppins (Vietnamese) only when there are Vietnamese characters. This allows the browser to load the smaller Poppins (Latin) font file unless it needs to display Vietnamese characters.

# Contribution Guidelines

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) to maintain consistent line-ending and indentation rules across all our projects. Ensure that you have the appropriate plugin installed in your preferred editor, or refer to `.editorconfig`
